# time-series Analysis of Forecasting of Airplane parts.
Objective :- To Forecast the number of part of a specific type will be replace be replace at particular region.

Description of Data :- We have dataset of different parts of airplane. In which, we have replacement date, installation date, region at which part replace,
season, How many hours flight fly after replacement.

We will group data by region and month. Then we will find out the Average life of part, many other variables.
After that we calculate the average life time of part and number of parts replaced in given time frame of airplane. 
Then we done some EDA on Time Series Data. From which, we find out the answer of some question.
 1. At which month, min and max part is replace and range of the value.
 2. Trend of replacement of part of particular month in a year.
 3. To check the seasonality, if it presents then find out the average value of part in different season and range. 
 4. To check the stationarity, i.e. mean and variance is varying about time or not.

After EDA Process, we apply time series model like ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponantial Smoothing ,Vector Auto Regression.
We will check the accuracy of each Model and find out the best model.
